## Requirements
- Make sure you have **Go version 1.22 or later** installed
- An email account with SMTP enabled (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

## Usage Notes
- By default, this library saves generated QR codes as PNG files.
- Ensure your SMTP provider allows third-party app access (some may require app-specific passwords).
- Best suited for testing, small projects
